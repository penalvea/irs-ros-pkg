Demo code for ESM real-time visual tracking

INRIA Sophia-Antipolis

Authors: Selim BENHIMANE and Ezio  MALIS (Ezio.Malis@sophia.inria.fr) 

Version 0.4, April, 2007

This directory contains a compiled library for performing real-time
visual tracking, a sample program showing the use of the ESM tracking
library and a 10 images test sequence.

A longer test sequence with 200 images can be downloaded from the ftp
site:

	ftp://ftp-sop.inria.fr/evolution/malis/software/ESM/seq1.tar.gz

See the web page at:

	http://esm.gforge.inria.fr

for references to the relevant papers describing the ESM approach.

----------------------------------------
Compiling and testing the sample program
----------------------------------------

The example program is named "src/ESMexample.c".

To compile the example code under Linux, type in the current directory:

% make 

This will create a program called "ESMexample" in the bin/ directory.

It should run under most versions of Linux on Intel compatible processors.

To execute the program, do in this directory:

% bin/ESMexample

This program tracks a rectangular area of interest (defined in
ESMexample.c) selected in the first image (seq/im000.pgm). The program
reads the PGM images from the directory seq/ and saves new PGM images
in the directory res/ with a rectangle overlayed indicating the
location of the area of interest in the current image. You can use any
tool (xv, gqview, gimp, ...) that displays the common PGM image format
to inspect the result.  With few modification, you can use the library
in a real-time application where the images are acquired on-line with
your favorite camera.
